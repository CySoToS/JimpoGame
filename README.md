##Aim

I personally build this project to learn more about Phaser by creating simple games. Udemy courses are the main source of understanding the library, as well as a few Youtube videos.

##Game Description
This is a simple game that will be build with the Phaser JS Engine.
All the needed graphics sounds and animations are build by Sotiris Loizou.
